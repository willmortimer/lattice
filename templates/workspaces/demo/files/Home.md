Kitchen-sink tour of the **First Look** sample workspace. Everything here is an
ordinary file under a real directory — open it in any editor, or stay inside Lattice.

**Native vs browser:** Perspective Preview, Vega-Lite Chart, and DuckDB Profile
require the **native desktop app** (`nxr desktop-dev` or Lattice.app). The Vite
browser fixture seeds the same files but labels visualization **unavailable**.
Installing Lattice.app does **not** rewrite an existing First Look folder — create
a new workspace from the First Look template, or copy missing seeds from
`templates/workspaces/demo/files/` (for example `Data/Events.dataset` and
`Dashboards/`).

## Quick start

1. Search with **⌘K** — keyword FTS is always on; semantic search is **off by default**. Enable it in **Settings → Search** for hybrid FTS + embeddings (try `latticed` or `FinalizationMode`).
2. Scroll [[Research/Long Read]] — long-form perf and virtualization fixture.
3. Open `Canvases/Product Strategy.canvas` — double-click file nodes to jump.
4. Capture with **⌘N** into `Inbox/` — type or **hold-to-dictate**; finals get glossary / ITN normalize (see [[Inbox/Sample capture]]).
5. Open `CRM.data` — contacts + companies, relations, board/gallery/calendar/form.
6. Also open `Projects/Delivery.data`, `Data/Metrics.data`, and `OKRs.data` for more table shapes.
7. Open `Data/Events.dataset` — DuckDB Parquet facts → Perspective **Preview**, Vega-Lite **Chart**, DuckDB **Profile**.
8. Open `Dashboards/Signups by region.vl.json` — bound Vega-Lite chart over the same Hive Parquet.
9. Open `Data/Orders.dataset` — multi-month retail facts (~3 000 rows) for richer charts.
10. Open the Orders dashboards — stacked region/category, daily revenue, and channel comparison (`.vl.json` under `Dashboards/`).
11. Browse `Resources/` for JSON, YAML, TypeScript, SQL, and the Lattice mark SVG.
12. Open `Notebooks/CRM exploration.ipynb` — CRM tour notebook (markdown + code stubs).
13. Create pages from `Templates/` — daily and meeting note scaffolds.
14. Read [[Research/Local Runtime]] — daemon, search, and voice process model.

## First Look tour — new surfaces

Work through this checklist to exercise the latest desktop shell, data, search,
and voice features. Each step is safe in the sample workspace; undo where noted.

### Search & local runtime

1. Press **⌘K** — keyword FTS works immediately (no download). Semantic search stays **off** until you enable **Settings → Search → Semantic search** (downloads ~640 MB local Qwen3 GGUF on first enable; or set `LATTICE_SEMANTIC_FAKE=1` for Fake vectors in dev).
2. Search for `VoiceContextBuilder` or `EndpointDetected` (seeded on [[Research/Local Runtime]]). With semantic on and ready, hybrid hits may show Keyword / Semantic / Both; otherwise expect keyword-only.
3. Skim [[Research/Architecture]] for the core vs latticed diagrams.

### Voice & Quick Note

4. Open any page → hold the microphone control to dictate; release for a single final insert (provisional text is ghost-only; finals run glossary / ITN normalize).
5. Press **⌘N** for Quick Note → hold-to-dictate → release → note saves once; Escape cancels without junk ASR text. Try glossary tokens from [[Research/Local Runtime]] (`FinalizationMode`, `CRM.data`).
6. Optional continuous mode: set `LATTICE_VOICE_AUTO_FINALIZE_ON_ENDPOINT=1` before launch (silence debounce endpoints); default hold-to-talk needs no VAD.

### CRM layouts and saved views

7. Open `CRM.data` and switch **Board**, **Gallery**, **Calendar**, and **Form** from the view picker.
8. In each layout, change the layout field pickers (group-by, cover field, date field, visible columns).
9. Click **Save view** to persist the layout under `CRM.data/views/` (native).
10. Open a contact row and inspect **company** and **reports_to** — add or change links in record detail.

### More data apps

11. Open `Projects/Delivery.data` — board by status + calendar on `due` (no relations; simpler schema).
12. Open `Data/Metrics.data` — decimal metrics board by category (Voice / Search / Data / Editor).
13. Open `OKRs.data` — objectives board by confidence status.

### CRM package forms

14. Open `CRM.data` → **Forms** → **Contact intake**.
15. Submit a new contact; the row appears and relation pickers stay in sync with `companies`.
16. Open `Projects/Delivery.data` → **Forms** → **Delivery intake** and add an item.

### Analytical datasets (DuckDB / Vega-Lite)

17. Open `Data/Events.dataset` → **Preview** — Perspective grid over Hive Parquet (`facts/year=2026/month=07/`).
18. Switch to **Chart** — auto Vega-Lite from the same Arrow IPC query.
19. Switch to **Profile** — DuckDB `SUMMARIZE` column stats.
20. Open `Dashboards/Signups by region.vl.json` — chart resource bound with `read_parquet(...)`.
21. Optional CLI: `lattice dataset query-annotated Data/Events.dataset --json` (review overlay in `annotations.sqlite`).

### Orders dataset & multi-series charts

22. Open `Data/Orders.dataset` → **Preview** — ~3 000 synthetic retail rows across `facts/year=2026/month=0{1,2,3}/`.
23. Open `Dashboards/Revenue by region and category.vl.json` — stacked bars (region × category).
24. Open `Dashboards/Revenue by day.vl.json` — daily revenue time series (Jan–Mar 2026).
25. Open `Dashboards/Revenue by channel.vl.json` — layered channel comparison (revenue bars + order counts).

### Resource tree

26. Create a folder under `Projects/` (context menu or **New folder**).
27. Press **⌘Z** to undo the folder creation.
28. Move [[Product/Vision]] into another folder; accept link repair when prompted.
29. **⌘-click** two pages, drag to a folder (multi-select move).
30. Select multiple items and delete — confirm the batch operation.

### CRM views

Open `CRM.data` and switch layouts from the view picker. The template seeds saved
views under `CRM.data/views/` (one YAML file per view):

| View | Layout | Key field |
| ---- | ------ | --------- |
| Board | `board` | `status` |
| Calendar | `calendar` | `due_date` |
| Gallery | `gallery` | `company` (cover) |
| Form | `form` | — |

Supported layout types also include `grid` and `list`. Board groups contacts by
`status`; calendar plots `due_date`; gallery uses `company` as a cover field.

The **company** column links each contact to a row in the seeded `companies` table.
The **reports_to** column is a self-relation on `contacts`. Template relation seeds
accept **record ids** or display **names** (matched via each target table's `name`
column at provision time).

### CRM package forms

| Form | Table | Fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| ContactIntake | `contacts` | `name`, `email`, `status`, `company` |

Embed a view from a page (see [[Research/Long Read]]):

```markdown
:::lattice-embed
resource: CRM.data/views/Board.yaml
fallback: "Open CRM board view"
:::
```
